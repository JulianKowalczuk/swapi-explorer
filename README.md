# SWAPI Explorer

### Scripts

`npm start` to go

### Description

Project for learning hooks purpose. No React.Component usage!
I use then/catch in useEffect, because async callback are not supported.
Pagination in Material-UI starts from zero, so I manipulate its value to call API for proper page.
